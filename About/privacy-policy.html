                <p>Automatic data collection technologies. Some of the automatic collection described above is facilitated by the following technologies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cookies, which are small text files that websites store on user devices and that allow web servers to record users’ web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences, and login status as they navigate a site. Cookies used on our sites may include both “session cookies” that are deleted when a session ends, “persistent cookies” that remain longer, “first party” cookies that we place and “third party” cookies that our third-party business partners and service providers place. </li>
                    <li>Local storage technologies, like HTML5, which allow web servers to record users’ web browsing activities and remember their submissions, preferences and login status as they navigate a site. Such local storage technologies may store information on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.</li>
                    <li>Web beacons, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>How we use your personal information</h5>

As part of these activities, we may create aggregated, de-identified or other anonymous data from personal information we collect.
